# Xbox 360 Neighborhood

## What Is It?

Xbox 360 Neighborhood (or Xbox Neighborhood for short) is an official Windows extension tool that is meant to be used with development kits, but also can be used on RGH/JTAG exploited consoles. The tool allows basic FTP features as well as live peek/poking of values and running XEX files remotely. Xbox Neighborhood is often used for modding as it provides a simple interface into your console.
