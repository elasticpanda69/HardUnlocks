### What is homebrew?

Homebrew refers to unofficial software written by hobbyists for locked down systems, 
like the Xbox 360. Homebrew can include original games, emulators, save-editing tools, and much, much more!

On the Xbox 360 in particular, you need the ability to run assigned code in order to use almost all available 
homebrew applications.
