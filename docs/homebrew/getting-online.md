# Stealth Servers

## What is a Stealth Server?

JTAG/RGH console users must take special precautions when connecting to Xbox Live in order to avoid getting banned 
instantly or within a few hours of connecting. Stealth server services such as [Proto (free)](https://freestealth.com/), [Nfinite (paid)](https://nfinite.live/), [Cipher 
(paid)](https://cipher.services/), or [Teapot (paid)](https://teapotlive.us/) exist to be a means of connecting "safely" to Xbox Live. Stealth servers 
will make your console appear as retail to the Xbox Live servers.
