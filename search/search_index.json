The hack relies on a vulnerability in the hardware found by GliGli that is  triggered by sending a reset pulse to the processor at a specific moment, resulting in a power glitch  that causes a bootloader hash check to return \"valid\" no matter what you have flashed in place of the  stock bootloader. The timing of when and how long the pulse should be sent is dependent on the console  and it may take some tweaking until it \"glitches\" and boots.</p>"},{"location":"#what-does-this-guide-install","title":"What does this guide install?","text":""},{"location":"#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>A basic toolkit which includes torx bits</li> <li>A device to read the consoles nand (xFlasher, NAND-X, JR-Programmer, MTX Flasher, Raspberry Pi Pico)</li> <li>Some 28-30awg single core wrapping wire (sometimes known as Kynar wire)</li> <li>A soldering iron and some soldering experience as you\u2019ll be working with tiny points.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#determining-your-motherboard-model","title":"Determining your motherboard model","text":""},{"location":"#what-exploitation-method-to-use","title":"What exploitation method to use?","text":"Exploit Xenon Zephyr Falcon/Opus Jasper Tonasket Trinity Coronas Winchester <code>JTAG</code> <code>R-JTAG</code> <code>R-JSTOP</code> <code>RGH1</code> <code>RGH1.2</code> <code>RGH2</code> <code>S-RGH</code> <code>Mufas</code> <code>EXT_CLK</code> TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD <code>RGH3</code>"},{"location":"downloads/","title":"Downloads","text":""},{"location":"downloads/#dashboards","title":"Dashboards","text":"File Version Link <code>Aurora</code> 0.7b.2 Download <code>Dashlaunch</code> 3.21 Download <code>FreeStyle Dash</code> 3.0.775 Download <code>FreeStyle Dash (Patched Version)</code> - Download <code>XeXMenu</code> 1.2 Download"},{"location":"downloads/#pc-tools","title":"PC Tools","text":"File Version Link <code>abgx360</code> 1.0.7 Download <code>Arisen Studio</code> - Download <code>FATXplorer</code> - Download <code>FileZilla</code> 3.67.1 Download <code>ISO2GOD</code> - Download <code>JRunner</code> 3.3.0 r3 Download <code>WinSCP</code> 6.3 Download <code>xbdm.xex</code> - Download <code>Xbox SDK</code> - Download <code>XDVDMulleter</code> - Download <code>XLink Kai</code> 7.4 Download"},{"location":"downloads/#xbox-360-tools","title":"Xbox 360 Tools","text":"File Version Link <code>XeLL</code> - Download <code>XM360</code> 2.0d Download"},{"location":"downloads/#emulators","title":"Emulators","text":"File Version Link <code>RetroArch360</code> 1.0.0.2 Download <code>SNES360</code> 0.32 Download"},{"location":"neigborhood/","title":"Xbox 360 Neighborhood","text":""},{"location":"neigborhood/#what-is-it","title":"What Is It?","text":"<p>Xbox 360 Neighborhood (or Xbox Neighborhood for short) is an official Windows extension tool that is meant to be used with development kits, but also can be used on RGH/JTAG exploited consoles.
